## Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**

  Used for the `ExpenseManager` struct to ensure that only one instance of the struct is created.

- **Factory Method**

  Used for the `ExpenseFactory` struct to create expenses based on the category. The factory method is the `create_expense` method.

- **Builder**

  Used for the `ExpenseBuilder` struct to create an expense. The builder pattern is used to create an expense with optional fields. The builder pattern is also used to create an expense with default values for the optional fields.

## Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**

  CSV and JSON exporters are adapters for the `ExpenseManager` struct. They are used to export the expenses to CSV and JSON formats.

- **Composite**

  The `ExpenseCategory` struct is a composite of `Expense` structs. It is used to group expenses by category.

- **Proxy**

  The `CachingExpenseManager` struct is a proxy for the `ExpenseManager` struct. It is used to cache the total expenses and avoid calculating it every time.

## Behavioral Patterns

- **Command**

  The `AddExpenseCommand`, `EditExpenseCommand`, and `DeleteExpenseCommand` structs are used to encapsulate the actions of adding, editing, and deleting an expense.

- **Iterator**

  The `ExpenseManager` struct implements the `Iterator` trait to iterate over the expenses prices.

- **Observer**

  The `ExpenseManager` struct implements the `Publisher` trait to notify observers when an expense is added, edited, or deleted.
